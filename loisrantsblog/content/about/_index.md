## ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

I'm Louis, a weeb, a nerd, a handsome young man! I was summoned into this world 4 years and 2 decades ago, and I'm located at one of the countries within the ring of fire, in south east Asia.

## ðŸ¤Ÿ What I do

I do magic with my keyboard. :keyboard:

I do magic with a pencil. :pencil:

I also do magic with my mind!! :brain: (kinda.)

I usually waste my time watching anime. Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯

I'll use this platform to share random thoughts that pop-up in my head during the day, ideas that may or may not be useful, rants on whatever it is I want to rant about, or whatever else I feel like writing.
