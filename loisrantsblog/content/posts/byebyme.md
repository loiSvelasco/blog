### bye by me, or is it bye bye me?

{{< youtube b3H5RvRHiYs >}}

The lyrics start with the word *Monday*, indicating the start of the speaker's day (or in this case, the singer). Followed by question: where are you going? For *Tuesday*, do you have work today? Until Friday, questions are asked. which gives me the following themes:


1. An elderly gentleman, who suffers from Alzheimer's.
1. A father, suffering from the same as above speaking to her daughter.
1. A man who suffers from amnesia.
1. A lost individual.


The first two themes make perfect sense; an elderly man speaking dearly to his significant other; a father speaking to his daughter, asking how her day was; what is happening; how is she doing; what is new; what stories can she tell; anything, just to have a conversation or to be in the loop with his loved ones. It is plausible, until you ponder the title.

### Bye by me

The last 2 themes may seem dark, sad, or dramatic. But our opinions may vary.
Let us (or me) talk about the third theme, which is a man who suffers from amnesia. 

In the latter minutes of the song, there is a part which roughly translates to 

*"Welcome home, but it's alright, I have nothing special to talk about."* and 
*"Welcome home, but it's okay, I can't remember anyway."*

and in an even later part, *"I remember how I loved you so much, I'll love you, if we ever meet again. You must not forget, I already told you what I wanted to say."*

Bye by me, or bye from me, since I might forget you.

For the fourth theme, a lost individual, here comes the **bye bye me**, explanation for this seems unnecessary (well, this whole blog post is unnecessary, I just wanted to publish my thoughts.) but anyway, returning to the topic, is a man who wants to leave this world, after expressing what he needs to express and telling what needs to be told, a man who is getting ready to leave this world.

I lean more on my third interpretation, but that's just my opinion. It may be miles apart from what the artists' true intentions are, but that's the beauty of it.
