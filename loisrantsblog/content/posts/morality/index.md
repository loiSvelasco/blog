I'm publishing this just to have easy access to this statement, which I 100% agree with.
{{< /alert >}}


a **MORAL ACT** is one that decreases individual human suffering and/or betters societal well-being, justice, freedom, and equality.

an **IMMORAL ACT** is one that increases individual human suffering and is a detriment to societal well-being, justice, freedom, and equality.

a **SINFUL ACT** is one that defies or violates religious doctrine or "God's Will", whether that act is *moral or not*


Calling someone "sinful" gives absolutely no moral weight to it, because it disconnects the thought or action from any real human condition.

Millions of people who "live in sin" are in fact moral.

Millions  of others use "God's Will" to perpetuate gross immoral behavior.

**so stop worrying about being a "sinner". It has no bearing on whether or not you're a good person.**
