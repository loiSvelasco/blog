### It sucks.

You won't know and will not have the chance to know what they think of you.
You think you might be doing someone a favor, but another person would think otherwise, which makes you feel ashamed.
They assume you have other motives than what you portray, and what they come up with is miles apart! What's worse is when
there are a lot of them!


The chance to prove them otherwise may not even come, so what else can I do? I can't change my personality; what I do comes straight from
my urge to help, to serve, so what if they think of me in a way that paints me a bad picture? As long as I don't look down on other people, step on them,
throw them off a cliff, and what not. I'll do what I think the right thing is to do. Let them talk behind my back. I would lie if I said I don't care, but I do.
I want people to like me, but you can't force them. Putting on a mask that hides the true me is not the right thing to do either. I'm lost, powerless to do
anything. But it's fine. I'm alright.


I had a long day at work today, and it seems like a good evening to finish a bottle of soju, alone, in a dark room, in front of a computer
screen, while blasting music to keep my ears busy. I'm not sure what else to say here, but I guess that's all my rant for today.


This might not be seen by anyone since I haven't publicized my website. I'm just talking to myself, but hey, it keeps my mind and hands busy. Which is a good thing considering what I'm feeling right now, dwelling on things I cannot control.
